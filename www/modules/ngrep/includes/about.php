<b>ngrep</b> strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer.  ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular  expressions to match against data payloads of packets.  It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump(8) and snoop(1).
